# Note the long term goal is that this crate is standalone and not
# dependent on the IOx Query Engine (even though this is not the case
# now).
#
# The rationale for this is:
#
# 1. Keep the API clean (and concerns separated) and allow for potential future reuse outside of IOx
# 2. Keep change/compile/link time down during development when working on just this crate
