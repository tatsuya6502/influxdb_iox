# Note this crate is designed to be standalone, and should not depend
# on the IOx Query Engine. The rationale is:
#
# 1. Keep the API clean (and concerns separated) and allow for potential future reuse outside of IOx
# 2. Keep change/compile/link time down during development when working on just this crate
